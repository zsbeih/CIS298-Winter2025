Self Assessment: each component of the enigma machine is built in its own class, so I believe I pass the part of the project to use object oriented design. Moving on, as seen in the screenshots below my enigma machine is fully running and takes in an input of 3 rotors, 3 positions, and the 20 letters or 10 pairs for the plugboard. Lastly, the unit testing is also in the screenshots below, and tests each component and the respective functions with multiple tests for each.
